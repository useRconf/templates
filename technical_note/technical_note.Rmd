## Abstract

[Short statement or paragraph summarizing the Technical Note. Up to 250 words.]

**Tips for structured abstract:** Background; Findings, the technical details of the method, how the method was performed and statistical tests used; Conclusions, brief summary and potential implications. Please minimize the use of abbreviations and do not cite references in the abstract.

### Keywords

R package development, R Shiny webapp, Bioinformatics

## Findings

The findings section can be broken into subsections with short informative headings. There is no maximum length for this section, but we encourage authors to be concise. You can include citations here [@allaire_rmarkdown_2020]. See example Markdown text below.

### Including Rmd subsections

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

### Including code

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including math
You can write math expressions using LaTeX formatting:
$$
ABC = pqr_{sub} \circ logABC
$$

### Including plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
