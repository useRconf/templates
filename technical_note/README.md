## R Markdown templates for Technical Notes

The suggested read time for the technical note is **5min**. [Here's a convertor from words -> time](https://wordstotime.com/).

We provide two templates:
1. Rmd with custom CSS template
2. Rmd using distill (using [`distill`](https://github.com/rstudio/distill) package)

We also include examples for other supporting files such bibliography (`.bib`), citation style (`.csl`).
